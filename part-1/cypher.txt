Cyber Security Breach:

In November 2014, Sony was targeted by a cyberattack that
was later attributed to North Korea. Somehow, hackers were
able to gain backdoor access to employee computers. Over
the course of a year, they copied files to their own
computers and deleted the source files, then finally
wiped each attacked computer. When the employees came to
work, their computers only showed a red skull image. The 
hackers then held the company data for ransom.

Weak passwords, Facebook phishing, and a lack of security layers enabled the
attack. "Password" was used as a password at least three 
times across the network, and once the hackers got into 
one server, they could easily reach the rest. 

Sony vowed to increase its phishing awareness, and
to partition its network better.
